    <P>
        The Pakistan Super League (PSL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league contested during February and March of every year by six teams representing six cities of Pakistan. The league was founded on 9 September 2015 with five teams by the Pakistan Cricket Board. Instead of operating as an association of independently-owned teams, the league is a single entity in which each franchise is owned and controlled by investors.

Each team plays the group stage matches in a double round robin format; the top four teams with the most points qualify for the playoffs, culminating in the final. The league is based in the Pakistan Cricket Board office in Lahore.

There have been seven seasons of PSL. Islamabad United has won 2 titles, making it the most successful team of PSL. The current champions are Lahore Qalandars, who won the 2022 season.

<p>In September 2015, the Pakistan Cricket Board officially announced the launch of the PSL. Former Pakistani national team captains Wasim Akram and Rameez Raja signed up to promote the PSL and become brand ambassadors of the league for three years.[2] After several years of planning and two previous failed attempts,[3][4] the league officially began on 4 February 2016 in the United Arab Emirates where daughter of former Pakistani president, Asif Zardari, Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari, alongside Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, inaugurated the opening ceremony.[5] The first two seasons included five teams based on the capital cities of Pakistan's provinces and the Federal capital.[6][7] In its first season the PSL had a higher percentage of international players. The league uses a draft system for player recruitment similar to that used in many North American professional sports leagues and as opposed to the auction system used in some other T20 leagues.[8]

The PSL's official logo was launched on 20 September 2015 in a ceremony in Lahore, and was revealed by 3Di.The ceremony was attended by current and retired cricketers, as well as Pakistani celebrities.

The commercial rights to the initial franchises were sold for US$93 million for a span of 10 years in December 2015. The market value of PSL in 2017 was up to US$300 million according to Arif Habib,[9] and has grown significantly in the years since.</p>
